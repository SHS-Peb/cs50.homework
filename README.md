# CS50x C Programming Homework Collection

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to various programming assignments from Harvard's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course. All projects are written in C and demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, arrays, algorithms, and data structures.

## How to Compile and Run

For each assignment, you can compile the code with `clang` or `gcc`. For example:

`clang hello.c -o hello`
`./hello`

or

`gcc mario.c -o mario`
`./mario`

## Tools & Environment

- C programming language
- `clang` or `gcc` compiler
- CS50 Library (if applicable)
- Terminal / Command line interface

## Notes

- These solutions are for learning purposes and to track my progress.
- Please do not copy for academic submission.
